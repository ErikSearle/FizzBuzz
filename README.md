# FizzBuzz
Simple application to generate sequences for the classic Fizz Buzz game

# Getting Started
Download both files and compile and run them from the command line. The program will take an integer input 'n' and output the correct Fizz Buzz sequence from 1-n

To compile from the command line follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have installed java and updated your system variables. Information on how to do this, is found here https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/windows-cmd.html
2. Download the files to your computer, and locate the folder which the file is in. This will likely be your downloads folder to begin with
3. Open the start menu and search for "command prompt". Open command prompt.
4. Command prompt will open as a black box, and there will be a flashing underscore at the end of a line that looks something like "C:\Users\your_name>". Type in the command "cd Downloads" (cd stands for change directory) and push enter. (This is assuming that your file is in your downloads folder. If it is in another folder, you will need to modify the command to "cd 'Your_Folder'". If the folder containing the file is within another folder or perhaps multiple folders deep, you may need to use the cd command multiple times, once for each folder level.)
5. If it worked correctly, you should now see a new line reading "C:\Users\your_name\Downloads>". You are now ready to compile the program. To compile type "javac Main.java" and push enter. If it works correctly, it should simply move down one line, and nothing else will have happened. To then compile the other file, type "javac FizzBuzzGenerator.java" and push enter. You should get the same result.
6. Now that your files have all been compiled, you can run your program. To do so type "java main" and push enter.
7. You should now see that the cursor apears to have moved down one line, but has not printed out the usual "C:\Users...". The program is running and waiting for your input. Type in a number and push enter. The program should print out a correct fizz buzz sequence up to and including your number
8. If you wish to test a different number, simply run the program again by typing in "java main" once more. There is no reason to recompile
